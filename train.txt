”Will be back to try their parfaits and their famous crepe cake”

”Small store compared to most other Winners Ive been to The selection leaves a lot to be desired too Maybe it was because on the day I came they were just setting up displays for the new merchandise ”

”Winners is where Canada shops because thats where you get a deal on a brand name ”

”However I still come here for Asian veggies and fruits that I cant find anywhere else like morning glory long an rambutan jackfruit They do have durian but its frozen and of course it doesnt taste like durian ”

”The smoked meats are great other dishes are hit and miss ”

”The service is all over the place one week we had the worst server we have ever experienced the next visit one of the best servers especially since he was the only server with just some help with clearing tables”

”My boyfriend and I also got 2 glasses of beer for him 750 each and a glass of sauvignon blanc for me 10 Prices to be expected for a downtown restaurant”

”Overall the food was underwhelming In all honesty if it were closer to where I live I may revisitbut it just isnt worth the trip to downtown Pittsburgh”

”McFate is arguably one of my favorite places to spend your nights as a beer nerd or as someone who ejoys supporting a local business”
